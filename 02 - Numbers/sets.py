# A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable and unindexed
# Sets are written in curly braces {}

# Unordered means that the item in a set do not have a defined order, it can appear in different order every time you use them, and cannot be refered to by index or key

# Unchangeable means we cannot change the items after the set has been created but we can remove and add new items

# Sets do not allows duplicate values, dv will be ignored
